Note that the visualize.m function has an extra input r0 which is the
position of the stance foot in the global frame. Why do we need this?

% We need it because we want to swap the leg type (stance/swing) without 
% changing their position. In this way we can achieve a realistic behaviour 
% of walking.

How does 'skip' affect this value?

% since we are skipping 'skip' frames, the animation time is inversely
% proportional to the 'skip' value.

What does a real time factor of 1 mean?

% It means that the time it takes for MATLAB to animate the simulations is
% equal to the simulation time.

How about a real time factor smaller than 1?

% It means that the time it takes for MATLAB to animate the simulations is
% longer than the simulation time (e.g. if the real time factor is 0.1, it
% means that the animation takes 10 times more time than the simulation)
